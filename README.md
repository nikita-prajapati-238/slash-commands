# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project requirements:
User can enter any command stating with / and the command should work as per its name suggest. e.g. if we write /upper in textarea, all the previously written lines in textarea should be converted in uppercase letter.
If user wants to add new slash command then it can be added. 
## Assumptions:
After typing slash commands, the existing text in textbox will be affected. Newly typed text after executing slash command will not affected.
## Limitations:
Currently in the project we have limited number of slash commands. In future we may increase number of predefined tags.
## Milestones:
In the first release we can provide support for some of the slash commands. We can hear review from customer for limited commands.
Then gradually we can increase predefined slash commands.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
